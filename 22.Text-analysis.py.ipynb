    "In 1949, Dr. RUdolf Flesch published The Art of Readable Writing, in which he proposed a measure of text readability known as the FLesh Index. This index is based on the average number of syllables per word and the average number of words per sentence in a piece of text. Index scores usually range from 0 to 100, and they indicate readable prose for the folling grade levels:\n",
